# my_matlab_rosbag

This is a matlab package which reads topics from rosbags, it uses the compiled code from: 
https://github.com/bcharrow/matlab_rosbag/releases

In the './tasks' folder I have scripts to extract the topics for my specific demonstrated tasks:
pouring, rolling, peeling, peg search

You need ROS to run it, otherwise have to compile the code from here:
