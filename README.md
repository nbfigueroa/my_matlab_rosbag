# my_matlab_rosbag

This is a matlab package which reads topics from rosbags, it uses the compiled code from: 
https://github.com/bcharrow/matlab_rosbag/releases

You need ROS to run it, otherwise have to compile the code from here:
https://github.com/bcharrow/matlab_rosbag

In the *./tasks* folder I have scripts to extract the topics for my demonstrated tasks:

- pouring 
- rolling 
- bimanual peeling 
- peg search

In the *./data* folder I have the *.mat* files extracted from the task specific demonstrations.
