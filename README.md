# my_matlab_rosbag

This is a matlab package which reads topics from rosbags, it uses the compiled code from:  
https://github.com/bcharrow/matlab_rosbag/releases

You need ROS to run it, otherwise have to compile the code from here: 
https://github.com/bcharrow/matlab_rosbag

In the *./tasks* folder I have scripts to extract the topics for my demonstrated tasks:

- pouring (1 arm, End Effector position/orientation and force/torque)
- rolling (1 arm, End Effector position/orientation and force/torque)
- bimanual peeling (2 arms, End Effector position/orientation and force/torque)
- jt-ds demos (1 arm, Joint positions and End Effector position/orientation)
- corl demos (1 arm, End Effector position/orientation and Gripper State)
- new wiping demos ( 1 arm, End Effector position/orientation and force/torque)
